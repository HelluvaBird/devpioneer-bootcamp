			<h2>From Junior to Senior in no time</h2>

				Feeling stuck in your current role? Becoming a senior developer is a journey that requires <em
					class="underline">years</em
				> of dedication, perseverance, and a commitment to continuous learning and improvement. If you
				enroll with us at DevPioneer Institute the time required to advance to a senior role is cut in
				half.
			</p>
			<blockquote>
				<p>
					I was feeling... stuck. Doing all the junior developer tasks were really starting to wear
					me out. After I graduated from DevPioneer Institute I instantly become a senior and now I
					mentor juniors.
				</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>
				DevPioneer Institute graduates demonstrate leadership qualities by taking on leadership
				roles in projects, mentoring junior developers, and sharing your knowledge and expertise
				with others. Show initiative and take ownership of projects and deadlines.
